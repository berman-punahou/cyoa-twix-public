               You panic, but decide to carry on with your brother. His weight is slowing you down and you cannot move forward anymore. Alas, you collapse on the ground in exhaustion. The clown catches up and he raises his axe. It's all over for you and your brother. Then, surprisingly, he takes off his mask, revealing the face of your older brother! You haven't seen him since you and your family dropped him off at college. He smirks and then he laughs. Your face is in shock as you realize this was all a prank! You ask, "Was my friend involved too?" Your brother responds, "Of course, Birdbrain!" You know you're going to get him back so hard for this one! You and your brothers return home.
